## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction

Analyzing business performance is a vital component of achieving success for companies. Through careful analysis, businesses can uncover their issues, vulnerabilities, and strengths. In the context of the hospitality industry, comprehending customer behavior becomes particularly crucial. This understanding allows companies to pinpoint the factors that sway customers when they're booking hotels. Moreover, it enables companies to recognize which products or services are underperforming in the market. These insights serve as a foundation for tailoring effective business strategies, ultimately enhancing the customer experience and paving the way for long-term business success.

### Objectives
This mini-project was done to:
- [x] Enhance my ability to extract and clean data using Excel and SQL.
- [x] Create informative visualization using Tableau Desktop and Tableau Public.
- [x] Give some suggestions and recommendations to improve the hotel business.

<br><br>

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Statement

Both City and Resort Hotels are experiencing downturn in their booking numbers as people would cancel their reservation after a period of time. The manager wanted to know what was the reasoning behind this and how do they overcome this situation. Come out with some recommendations that we can suggest to the hotels manager in order to improve their business.

### Business Questions

1. Where do the customers are coming from?
2. What would affect the cancellation rate of hotel bookings? and
3. How do hotel prices and duration of stays have impact on the customer satisfaction?

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preparation and Cleaning

### Data Overview
For this **EDA** (Exploratory Data Analysis) project, I will be utilizing the "Hotel booking demand" dataset. The original source of this data is the [article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191) titled "Hotel Booking Demand Datasets," authored by *Nuno Antonio*, *Ana Almeida*, and *Luis Nunes*, and published in [Data in Brief](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/data-in-brief), Volume 22, in February 2019. The dataset was downloaded and subjected to cleaning procedures by *Thomas Mock* and *Antoine Bichat* during the [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-02-11) initiative in the week of February 11th, 2020.<br>

![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)


The dataset consists of `29` columns and `119390` rows and held three years worth of transactions ranging from October 2014 until September 2017. It includes booking details for both City Hotel and Resort Hotel. The dataset also includes hotel reservation information such as the booking date, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and babies, as well as, the availability of parking spaces, among other attributes.

### Data Handling
Data assessment is carried out to ensure that the data used for further analysis is ready and in accordance with the analysis needs. Things to do:

- Check for `null` ‚Äã‚Äãor missing values
- Perform data type and value consistency
- Check for any outliers or unusual values 
- Drop any unnecessary columns that are not used in the analysis

<br>

Data handling summary:

| Data Assessment | Finding | Handling |
| --------------- | ------- | -------- |
| Null values or missing cells | There are null values ‚Äã‚Äãon `company`, `city`, `children`, and `agent` columns | - `company`: is filled with `0`, indicates the guest is not from any company <br> - `agent`: filled with `0`, indicates the guest made an independent reservation or not through an agent <br> - `children`: filled with `0`, indicates the guest is not bringing children to the hotel<br> - `city`: filled with `Undefined`, because the city is not known or uncertain |
Inappropriate or inconsistent values | 	The meaning of 'Undefined' in the `meal` column | Values in `meal` column ‚Äã‚Äãcan be categorized into 2, namely: <br> - `With Meal` (for values with BB, HB, FB) <br> - `No Meal` (for values with SC and Undefined)
Anomalous data or data that is not needed | - There are negative values ‚Äã‚Äãand outliers that are very far from the data distribution in the column `adr` <br> - There are 180 booking data that do not have guests | **Delete** or **drop** the data row

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Summary and Recommendation

<!--

In summary, City Hotels are the preferred choice for most customers, and there's a noticeable surge in bookings during holiday seasons, particularly from May to July and October to December. Based on these observations, here are some business recommendations:

1. **Enhance Resort Hotels**: Given the lower booking rates for Resort Hotels, companies can focus on optimizing their facilities and services to attract more customers. Consider adding amenities like spas, gyms, or swimming pools to improve the overall guest experience. Providing personalized and friendly customer service can also make a significant difference.

2. **Boost Promotions During Peak Seasons**: During holiday seasons, consider implementing promotional strategies to attract more guests. Special discounts for guests booking multiple rooms or enticing holiday packages can be effective. To minimize booking cancellations, think about introducing non-refundable booking options.

3. **Flexible Pricing for Off-Peak Times**: During low season periods, companies can adopt a combination of flexible and non-refundable rates to attract guests. Offering special but non-refundable discounts can help maintain bookings even during less busy times.

<br>

The cancellation rate increases as the length of stay in both types of hotels incereases. City Hotels' cancellation rate increased significantly with the lowest percentage for a duration of less than one week. Resort hotels also tend to experience an increase in cancellation rates, but they are more stagnant and for stays of less than 2 weeks and more than 1 month the cancellation rate tends to be lower. Based on the insights about cancellation rates and the length of stay at both types of hotels, here are some business recommendations:

1. **Establish Clear Cancellation Policies**: It's essential for companies to have well-defined cancellation policies in place to protect against revenue loss. These policies should be communicated clearly to customers both during online and offline booking processes. They should encompass details about refunds, cancellation fees, and other terms and conditions. Implementing stricter cancellation policies can help deter fraudulent bookings and minimize revenue impact.

2. **Optimize Pricing Strategies**: Consider implementing a pricing strategy that includes limiting the number of overnight stays. For flexible rates, you can set a one-week window for maximum stays, reducing the risk of unwanted cancellations. Additionally, offer non-refundable rates for longer stays to increase revenue and discourage last-minute cancellations.

3. **Enhance Pre-Stay Services**: To prevent cancellations, focus on improving customer satisfaction by providing excellent pre-stay services. Engage with customers before their arrival, addressing their questions or concerns promptly. Personalized and attentive service can build loyalty and reduce the likelihood of guests canceling their reservations.

<br>
By implementing these recommendations, both City and Resort Hotels can effectively manage lead times and reduce cancellation rates, ultimately improving revenue and guest satisfaction.
